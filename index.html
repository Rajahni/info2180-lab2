                        On September 7, 2022, Apple revealed the brand new Iphone 14 Pro and Pro Max.
                        These phones are very similar to their predecessors, however, they come with a
                        brand new A16 processor, a new camera system and engine that Apple calls "Photonic Engine".
                        The newest, most distinguishable feature, is the brand new "Dynamic Island."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dynamic Island is indeed an eye catching work of art. The newly designed notched
                        which is now a pill shaped cut-out has been designed to highlight status notifications such 
                        music playing, timer set, FaceID unlock etc. Smoothly animated tabs and widgets expand from
                        the cut-out as is needed, giving users ease of access to view live states of applications.
                        Apple has undoubtedly created a new feature that will enhance the user experience of their
                        device.

                        I'm an enthusiastic tech lover who loves to study the ins and outs of devices which have
                        grasped my attention. My current course of study is Computer Science with a minor in Economics.
                        My goals with this blog include bringing knowledge to new, fun gadgets within the industry.

                        My future prospects see me developing websites and software especially within the Jamaican
                        landscape. The future of technology is undoubtedly bright, therefore, it is valuable to
                        improve our local markets by aiding business owners with transitioning to the global online 
                        community in order to make their businesses run more efficiently. The aim is to create a new
                        narrative for 'Jamaican Websites'. They can be more attractive and easy to navigate.
                        I would love to work towards seeing that happen.
